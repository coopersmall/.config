## What?

All of my .config folders (that aren't private :D)

## Why?

I got tired off all of my configurations being in different places so put them all here

## Setup

You will need to:

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the dependencies

**Step 1:**

Clone the repo

```sh
cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/coopersmall/.config.git
```

**Step 2**

Install the dependencies

```sh
cd ~/.config && make deps
```

## Packages

The setup script will install the following packages
